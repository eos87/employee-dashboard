# Employee Dashboard

[![Employee Dashboard Tests](https://github.com/eos87/employee-dashboard/actions/workflows/runAppTests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/eos87/employee-dashboard/actions)

Employee Dashboard is a React project that was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is a simple web app that allows users to see a dashboard with a list of employees, a couple of simple charts and that also allows adding new employees.

### Getting Started

To get started with Employee Dashboard, clone the repository to your local machine and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run e2e`

This command will start the application and run the Cypress end-to-end tests in an Electron headless browser. You will see the output of the tests in your terminal.
Alternatively, if you want to see the tests in action in-browser (visually running), you can run `npx cypress open` and run them from the manually.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
